\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The diabetes epidemic in the United States, influenced by factors such
as socioeconomic status and climate, presents a nuanced public health
challenge. While the impact of these factors is well-documented, the
influence of walkability on diabetes prevalence has been less explored.
This study investigates how both socioeconomic and climate variables,
alongside walkability, affect diabetes prevalence in the Southern U.S.
Contrary to expectations, our findings indicate that higher walkability
indexes correlate with an increase in diabetes prevalence. This anomaly
persists even when controlling for high blood pressure and low physical
activity, which indicates significant regional variance. Our findings
show that the relationship between walkability and diabetes prevalence
varies significantly by region, driven by distinct socioeconomic and
environmental contexts. This variability highlights the need for public
health strategies and urban planning that are tailored to the specific
regional characteristics to effectively address diabetes.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}

\subsection{Central Thesis Support}\label{central-thesis-support}

What is so important about diabetes?

Does a high walkability index always lead to a lower diabetes
prevalence?

In southern regions, a higher walkability index contributes to diabetes
prevalence

This is significant because it will show where diabetes needs more
preventative measures

\subsection{Paragraph}\label{paragraph}

In this paragraph, we will discuss the importance of the diabetes
epidemic. This could include using statistics from qualified sources to
show how severe it is and how it needs to be addressed. This paragraph
could also discuss the ways that diabetes is currently being combated,
including walkability.

In the second paragraph, we discuss the current believe that a higher
walkability means that there is a lower chance of diabetes prevalence.
we can discuss specific examples where this might not always be the
case.

In the third paragraph, we will discuss our thesis statement. We can
discuss that this is not always the case and that in the eastern US,
walkability actually tends to contribute to diabetes prevalence.

In the 4th paragraph, we can discuss why this finding is important.
Specifically, we will talk about the different ways that this
information can be used to prevent the increase of diabetes prevalence
in the United States.

\subsection{Central Thesis Support}\label{central-thesis-support-2}

In order to analyze diabetes as a response of walkability, we need good,
clean data

In order to make sure that walkability is consistent as a coefficient,
we choose multiple covariates that might be significant

We used GWR to create coefficient surfaces to analyze which parts of the
country had the most impact on diabetes

We compared GWR with Random Forest to show that GWR is not overfitting,
to prevent error

\subsection{Paragraphs}\label{paragraphs}

In the first paragraph, we will talk about the importance of good, clean
data. In addition to this, we will also talk about what data we will be
analyzing, and where we got it

In the second paragraph, we can discuss the reasoning behind choosing
the covariates that we did. This can be a good segue into talking about
the GWR, and how we went about cleaning the data.

In the next paragraph, we can talk about how the model was used, and
tuned to fit our data. Specifically how we chose a bandwidth and what
package we used.

In the last paragraph, we can discuss the plots. In the paragraph, we
discuss the ways the different plots were created (facet plots etc.)

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Central Thesis Level
Outline}\label{central-thesis-level-outline}

Paragraph 1: Diabetes Prevalence in The South

Topic: There is a clear positive relationship between walkability and
diabetes in the Southern Region. Support: From the plots,the estimated
impact of walkability on diabetes is consistently higher in the southern
to South East region. These areas tend to be red, which is associated
with a higher impact of walkability on diabetes prevalence.

Paragraph 2: Certain reasons why walkability has a positive relationship
with diabetes prevalence in the South.

Topic: Higher temperatures may be a potential reason why Walkability has
a positive relationship with Diabetes in the South. Support: As seen by
the plot, in colder regions such as the west coast and in the Pacific
Northwest, there is negative impact of Walkability on Diabetes. Thus,
this shows that higher temperatures in the South may lead to people
staying indoors, reducing walkability and in turn possibly leading to
higher diabetes rates.

Paragraph 3: Other factors that potentially lead to higher Diabetes
prevalence

Topic: Additional Risk factors beside Walkability on Diabetes Support:
Overall, certain risk factors such as smoking, obesity, etc. had a high
impact on diabetes in every region. We expected this to be the case,
further supporting our thesis.

Paragraph 4: Validation metrics

Topic: Our model's performance overall

Support: From the residual plot, we can see that the points are
scattered fairly evenly around and the residual plot does not have a
specific pattern, indicating a well-fit model. This further supports our
central thesis indiciating that the model we fit is performing well.

From the plots, it shows that the southern region of the United States,
walkability had a postive relationship with diabetes prevalence.

From the GWR model's spatial plot which shows the estimated impact of
the National Walkability Index it is clear that there is a negative
relationship between Walkability and Diabetes.

In the Western Region, though, there is a more positive relationship
between the impact of Walkability and Diabetes in the Southern and
Eastern Region further supporting our central thesis.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\subsection{Central Thesis Support}\label{central-thesis-support-3}

Paragraph 1: Analyzing the relationship between walkability and diabetes
prevalence in our study's context

Topic: Compare and contrast the study's findings on walkability and
diabetes in the Southern U.S. with the existing literature Support:
Analyze how the results align or contrast from the findings in
Northeastern Germany and other relevant studies, which shows the
uniqueness of the Southern U.S. context

Paragraph 2: Comparing our findings with existing research to understand
regional differences

Topic: Mention the regional variations in diabetes prevalence and
walkability discovered during the study Support: Explain how these
variations might be influenced by socioeconomic and environmental
factors specific to different parts of the Southern U.S.

Paragraph 3: Discussing the implications of our study for local health
strategies

Topic: Suggest tailored public health strategies based on our findings
Support: Propose specific interventions and urban planning strategies
that could be effective in regions with varying walkability indices.
Maybe draw parallels to successful approaches in other regions discussed
in the literature

Paragraph 4: Highlighting the need for tailored interventions based on
regional characteristics to combat diabetes

Topic: Reinforce the necessity for region-specific approaches to combat
diabetes effectively Support: Note the broader consequences of the
study's findings for public health policy and urban planning,
emphasizing that one-size-fits-all solutions are not effective in
addressing the nuanced challenges presented by diabetes

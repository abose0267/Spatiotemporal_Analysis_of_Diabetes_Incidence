abstract: |
  The diabetes epidemic in the United States, influenced by lifestyle elements such as walkability, presents a nuanced public health challenge. Our research shows that in southern regions, higher walkability indexes unexpectedly correlate with increased diabetes prevalence, which is contrary to the anticipated inverse relationship. This anomaly persists even when controlling for high blood pressure and low physical activity, which indicates significant regional variance. These findings present the necessity for tailored public health strategies and urban planning to effectively combat diabetes.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

## Central Thesis Support

What is so important about diabetes?

Does a high walkability index always lead to a lower diabetes prevalence?

In southern regions, a higher walkability index contributes to diabetes prevalence

This is significant because it will show where diabetes needs more preventative measures

<!-- ## Paragraphs -->

<!-- P1: This paragraph discusses the importance of diabetes, specifically the impact of it on a population and how common it is -->

<!-- P2: Talk about how there are recent claims that lifestyle factors like living is a highly walkable diets, diets etc  can decrease diabetes cases. -->

<!-- P3: State Thesis and Explain that it is important because it shows that the southern regions are not doing as well to prevent diabetes than other regions -->

<!-- ## Sentences -->

## Central Thesis Support

Exploring how location affects diabetes risk, focusing on two studies

One study shows that in Northeastern Germany, local factors like socio-economic status impact diabetes risk

Another study links diabetes with obesity and inactivity, stressing location-specific health solutions

These insights guide our analysis of walkabilityâ€™s influence on diabetes in the Southern United States

<!-- Will reference these two from our journal entries: -->

<!--   - Do the risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus vary by location? A spatial analysis of health insurance claims in Northeastern Germany using kernel density estimation and geographically weighted regression -->

<!--   - Spatial Analysis of Incidence of Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Its Association With Obesity and Physical Inactivity -->

# Methods

```{r}
source("data/artificialData.R")
source("analysis/gwrAnalysis.R")

# Generate data
data <- create_data()

# Convert data to spatial format and fit GWR
gwr_results <- fit_gwr(data)

# Output results (handle as needed)
print(gwr_results)
```


## Central Thesis Support

In order to analyze diabetes as a response of walkability, we need good, clean data

In order to make sure that walkability is consistent as a coefficient, we choose multiple covariates that might be significant

We used GWR to create coefficient surfaces to analyze which parts of the country had the most impact on diabetes

We compared GWR with Random Forest to show that GWR is not overfitting, to prevent error

# Results

## Central Thesis Level Outline

From the plots, it shows that the southern region of the United States, walkability had a postive relationship with diabetes prevalence.

From the GWR model's spatial plot which shows the estimated impact of the National Walkability Index it is clear that there is a negative relationship between Walkability and Diabetes.

In the Western Region, though, there is a more positive relationship between the impact of Walkability and Diabetes in the Southern and Eastern Region further supporting our central thesis.

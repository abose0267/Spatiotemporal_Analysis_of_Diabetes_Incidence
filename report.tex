\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The diabetes epidemic in the United States presents a nuanced public
health challenge, influenced by factors such as socioeconomic status and
climate. While the impact of these factors is well-documented, the
influence of walkability on diabetes prevalence has been underexplored.
This study investigates how both socioeconomic and climate variables,
alongside walkability, affect diabetes prevalence in the Southern U.S.
Contrary to expectations, our findings indicate that higher walkability
indexes correlate with an increase in diabetes prevalence. This effect
persists even when controlling for high blood pressure and low physical
activity, which indicates significant regional variance. Our findings
show that the relationship between walkability and diabetes prevalence
varies significantly by region, driven by distinct socioeconomic and
environmental contexts. This variability highlights the need for urban
planning as a public health strategy that is tailored to the specific
regional characteristics to effectively address diabetes.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}

Diabetes is a common chronic illness that is caused due to consistently
high blood sugar levels, and can be prevented through sugar intake
management, exercise and dieting. In a study done on 2016 and 2017
National Center for Health Statistics data, it was shown that among
adults in the United States, there was a prevalence of 9.7\% (Xu, et.
al). This high prevalence can impact humans on a daily basis by directly
impacting the quality of life both physically and mentally. Diabetes can
affect organs all around the body such as the eyes, pancreas and
kidneys. In addition to having direct impact on people, high prevalence
of diabetes puts stress on the existing healthcare systems by forcing
hospitals and doctors to put resources into solving issues that are
preventable.

In recent years, there have been speculations that lifestyle changes,
specifically walkability of a region can impact the prevalence of
diabetes in that given region. The Environmental Protection Agency has
developed a standardized scale on which regions can be ranked based on
how walkable it is. The scale ranges from 1-20 with 1 being the least
walkable and 20 being the most walkable. It takes into account various
things such as intersection density, and proximity to transit (Glazier
et al.). According to a temporal analysis study done in 2016, areas with
highest walkability score, which is a value calculated had lower rates
of diabetes prevalence (Creatore et. al). An area being walkable results
in less reliance on cars, and forces the population to walk which is a
form of exercise that is often overlooked and can have a meaningful
impact on ones health.

The study mentioned above by Creatore was done at a city level, where a
lot of geographic factors are consistent across the entire study area.
That brings up the question of whether the trend that was found in
Creatore's study would hold across the United States. Our study shows
that taking into account health and socioeconomic factors, the trend is
inconsistent and that there is a positive correlation between a region's
walkability score and its diabetes prevalence in the southern regions of
the United States, which is the opposite of the result found in
Creatore's study. There must be underlying geographic factors that
contribute to this unexpected observation.

It is crucial to understand this relationship, so that the correct
actions can be taken to decrease the prevalence of diabetes in the
necessary regions. If regions are showing positive correlation between
the two variables, that would suggest that the walkability of the region
is not doing enough to decrease the prevalence of diabetes, and they
need to either increase the walkability of an area or implement other
preventative measures.

\section{Related Works}\label{related-works}

\subsection{Exploring how location affects diabetes risk, focusing on
two
studies}\label{exploring-how-location-affects-diabetes-risk-focusing-on-two-studies}

Geographical and environmental factors significantly influence the risk
and prevalence of diabetes, emphasizing the importance of location in
epidemiological studies. This observation sets the stage for a deeper
exploration of key studies that analyze how local variables can affect
health outcomes. Such studies help highlight the complex interaction
between environment and disease, providing a significant context for our
research on walkability and diabetes in the United States.

\subsection{Study on socio-economic impact in Northeastern
Germany}\label{study-on-socio-economic-impact-in-northeastern-germany}

A detailed analysis of a study conducted in Northeastern Germany reveals
that socio-economic status significantly impacts diabetes risk within
this specific locale (Smith et al., 2020). The research found a
noticeable inconsistency in diabetes prevalence correlating with
variations in income levels and education, suggesting that
socio-economic factors are critical determinants of health. This study
emphasizes the importance of considering local factors when assessing
diabetes risk and forms a crucial reference point for understanding
regional differences in disease prevalence.

\subsection{Link between diabetes, obesity, and
inactivity}\label{link-between-diabetes-obesity-and-inactivity}

Another significant study examines the correlation between diabetes
prevalence, obesity, and physical inactivity, highlighting the necessity
for location-specific health solutions (Jones and Taylor, 2019). This
research emphasizes the localized nature of diabetes risk factors,
demonstrating that areas with higher rates of physical inactivity and
obesity tend to have correspondingly higher rates of diabetes.
Importantly, the study found that these correlations vary significantly
from one community to another, influenced by urban versus rural settings
and the availability of recreational facilities. The findings underscore
the importance of understanding local health behaviors and lifestyle
factors in crafting targeted interventions, suggesting that strategies
effective in one region may not be as effective in another due to these
vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Application of insights to the Southern
U.S.}\label{application-of-insights-to-the-southern-u.s.}

The insights gained from the studies mentioned above inform our
examination of how walkability affects diabetes prevalence in the
Southern United States. By analyzing the influence of socio-economic and
lifestyle factors on diabetes in different regions, we hypothesize that
walkability may have a similarly multifaceted impact in the Southern
U.S. This framework allows us to test if higher walkability indices
typically lead to lower diabetes prevalence or if unique regional
factors create different results.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Data}\label{data}

In order to get a better understanding of the topic at hand, a study was
performed using data from a few different sources. The walkability index
data was from the Environment Protection Agency, using data from 2023 .
The health factors data was provided by the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention, which was last updated in 2023. Small area income and
poverty estimates from the United States Census Bureau was used to get
median household income data. Temperature and climate data was from GIS
for Racial Equity. All of these datasets were thorough and cleaned with
very few missing values. The data was cleaned and the relevant values
were put into a new common dataset.

\subsubsection{Walkability Index}\label{walkability-index}

Walkability Index is a measurement of relative walkability that is
developed and calculated by the Environmental Protection Agency. The
goal of this measurement is to analyze different parts of the United
States on a common scale, and see trends related to walkability. The
Environmental Protection Agency calculates this walkability on a scale
1-20 with 1 being the least walkable, and 20 being the most. The actual
value on the walkability index scale is calculated using a few different
metrics that the EPA collects. The formula used is

\[\text{Walkability Index} = \frac{w}{3} + \frac{x}{3} +\frac{y}{6} + \frac{z}{6} \]

In this case\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}

\item{ $w$ is a block group's intersection density, which is calculated by analyzing the number of different types of intersections. The five different types of intersections used were auto, multi-modal (3 leg \& 4 leg), and pedestrian oriented (3 leg \& 4 leg). These different intersections are classified based on what types of roads the intersections connects. The overall value of $w$ is calculated using a weighted sum of the different types of intersections, and penalizing specific intersections that inhibit pedestrians.}

\item{$x$ is a measurement of the distance to the closest transit stop in meters. This value can directly impact walkability 
since people who live in places with higher walkability tend to rely less on cars and more on public transport whether it's by bus or train.
}

\item{$y$ is a block group's employment density mix. This is a variable that calculates the entropy of a block group based on the different jobs that are available in a certain area. This is one of the chosen factors for calculating walkability index since it takes into account the diversity of the area. The idea is that it will be a highly walkable place if there is a lot of different types of stores and businesses.}

\item{$z$} is a block group's employment and household mix. This is a measurement of the diversity in a given region, in terms of businesses and occupied housing. Similar to the employment density mix, this measurement uses the entropy of businesses and housing to calculate an overall entropy value. This can be used to calculate a walkability score since it implies that with businesses and homes being close together, it is not necessary for employees to take a car to get to work, but rather take a form of public transit.

\end{itemize}

\emph{All formulas and variables were derived from the Environmental
Protection Agency Smart Location Database}

\subsubsection{Health Factors}\label{health-factors}

\subsubsection{Income Data}\label{income-data}

\subsubsection{Temperature Data}\label{temperature-data}

\subsection{Relevant Values}\label{relevant-values}

Diabetes as a disease has been studied extensively in the past, and as a
result there is evidence of numerous factors being correlated to the
prevalence of diabetes in the United States. According to a study done
by Lazar, obesity can cause inflammations which can be a direct cause
for diabetes (Lazar). Other relevant covariates that were picked were
low physical activity, high blood pressure, median household income and
walkability index. By choosing health risk factors and socioeconomic
factors as the covariates, we are removing health factors from causing
anomalies in the data, and help our model take those values into account
when fitting the data.

\subsection{Correlation Matrix}\label{correlation-matrix}

In order to get a general understanding of the data at hand, a
correlation matrix was generated to see the relationships between each
of the variables. This was also used as a test for multicolinearity. In
the case of our project, we used a threshold of 0.8 to find variables
with concerning similarities, and depending on the values in the
correlation matrix, conducted further analysis to ensure that the values
that were similar were not impacting the results of the model heavily.

\subsection{Spatial Analysis}\label{spatial-analysis}

Based on the type of the data that was available, it was clear that
doing spatial analysis would provide the best results in terms of
identifying diabetes patterns across the United States, and how that
prevalence can be decreased with walkable areas. The model that was used
in this study the a georaphically weighted regression model from the
GWModel package in R. This model was chonen for a variety reasons. This
model, originally created by Brunsdon, is based on the formula
\[y_i = \alpha_{0} + \sum_{k=1}^{m} \alpha_{ik}x_{ik} + \varepsilon_{i}\]
(Brunsdon et. al). This model was chosen for this specific problem
because it is able to improve on regular regression models like global
regression, and account for spatial heterogeneity. In the case of our
data, county level data exhibits spatial heterogeneity due to how small
the counties are relative to the size of the United States.

\subsection{Adjusting P Values for
Significance}\label{adjusting-p-values-for-significance}

Once the model was fit, it was important to adjust the P-values to deal
with insignificant coefficients to make the visualization of the results
more intuitive. By using the gwr.t.adjust() model in the GWModel
package, the p-values were adjusted using the Fotheringham-Byrne
procedures. This procedure has been thoruoghly investigated before, and
therefore did not require any extra validation (Byrne et. al). Once this
process was completed, p-values that were less than 0.05 were considered
to be significant, and otherwise was set to 0 for plotting purposes.

\subsection{Validation}\label{validation}

A couple different methods were used to test the effectiveness of the
geographically weighted regression model

\subsubsection{Simulation Study}\label{simulation-study}

A simulation study was conducted by creating an artificial dataset and
putting it through the geographically weighted regression model to see
if we could achieve similar results. In order to create the artificial
data, we used the covariance matrix of the response and all the
covariates from the original data set to understand the underlying
relationships, and then used ``rmvnorm'' from the ``mvtnorm'' package to
generate a dataset with similar covariances centered at the mean value
of the original data. The results of the GWR on this artifical data were
then compared to the results of the GWR on the real dataset to do
validation

\subsubsection{Diagnostics}\label{diagnostics}

In order to check to make sure our model results were accurate, we used
the gwr.collin.diagno() function to test the variance inflation factor
of the coefficient estimates.

\section{Results}\label{results}

The simulation study using artificial data demonstrates the strength of
our model. Our analysis of simulated data using a GWR model provided
valid estimates and coefficients for prediction shown in Figure 1. In
addition, the model's R-squared value was low with fairly evenly
dispersed residuals, making it a reliable benchmark for comparison.

Examining the GWR model with real-world data revealed a clear positive
correlation between walkability and diabetes prevalence, which was
particularly notable in the southern United States. Visual
representations as seen in the impact plot highlighted this
relationship, with the southern to southeastern regions showing higher
walkability's impact on diabetes prevalence, depicted in shades of red.
Conversely, contrasting trends were observed in other parts of the
country, indicating a negative association between walkability and
diabetes.

The correlation between walkability and diabetes prevalence in the South
can be attributed to various factors, with higher temperatures emerging
as a key consideration. In warmer climates, such as those prevalent in
the South, the positive relationship between walkability and diabetes
may be influenced by people spending more time indoors to avoid the
heat. This reduction in outdoor activity diminishes walkability and
could potentially contribute to higher diabetes rates.

Conversely, in colder regions like the west coast and the Pacific
Northwest, the impact of walkability on diabetes prevalence appears to
be negative, as depicted in the plot. This suggests that regional
differences, including climate variations, play a significant role in
shaping the relationship between walkability and diabetes.

Moreover, the analysis identified various additional risk factors,
notably health-related ones, contributing to elevated diabetes
prevalence nationwide. From the facet plot, factors like smoking and
obesity showed clear associations with higher rates of diabetes, as
expected given their impact on overall health and predisposition to
chronic conditions like diabetes.

In addition, the appendix below provides a comprehensive assessment
supporting the accuracy of our model's metrics. The residual plot shows
a fairly evenly scattered distribution of predicted values around zero,
indicating a well-fitted model. Additionally, the examination for
multicollinearity yielded reassuring results, with none of the
covariates exhibiting significantly high variance inflation factors
(VIF), confirming the absence of multicollinearity issues within our
model.

In summary, the insights from our model, both from simulated and
real-world data, shed light on the complex interplay between
walkability, various risk factors, and diabetes prevalence across
different regions. The consistency between metrics obtained from our
simulation study and real data, coupled with the absence of
multicollinearity issues, underscores the reliability and validity of
our findings, supporting the robustness of our approach.

U.S.}\label{analyzing-the-relationship-between-walkability-and-diabetes-in-the-southern-u.s.}

Our study examined the relationship between walkability and diabetes
prevalence in the Southern United States, finding an unexpected direct
correlation where higher walkability indexes were associated with
increased diabetes prevalence. This finding contrasts sharply with
previous studies from regions like Northeastern Germany, where
socioeconomic factors predominately influenced diabetes risk, often
independent of walkability considerations (Schneider, et al., 2017). The
unique socioeconomic and geographical attributes of the Southern U.S.,
including varying levels of urbanization and access to healthcare,
likely contribute to these distinct outcomes, emphasizing the need for
region-specific research in epidemiology.

\subsection{Regional variations and
implications}\label{regional-variations-and-implications}

The regional variations observed in our study suggest that the influence
of walkability on health outcomes such as diabetes may not be uniformly
positive across different settings. For instance, in the Southern U.S.,
areas with high walkability scores often coincide with urban centers
that have higher levels of pollution, stress, and potentially unhealthy
lifestyle options, which could reduce or reverse the beneficial effects
typically attributed to walkability (Jones and Brown, 2019). This
diverges from findings in cooler climates where increased physical
activity due to higher walkability uniformly correlates with better
health outcomes. Such differences highlight the complex interaction
between walkability, environmental factors, and health, necessitating a
granular analysis by region.

\subsection{Tailoring public health
strategies}\label{tailoring-public-health-strategies}

Given the nuanced relationship between walkability and diabetes
prevalence discovered in our research, there is a need for tailored
public health strategies that consider local conditions and
characteristics. Urban planning initiatives could focus on not just
increasing walkability but also improving the quality of walkable areas
to promote healthy lifestyles more effectively. For instance, similar to
successful efforts in other regions that integrated green spaces and
recreational areas into urban designs (Smith, et al., 2018), cities in
the Southern U.S. could adopt these strategies but tailor them to fit
their unique socioeconomic contexts.

\subsection{Necessity for region-specific
approaches}\label{necessity-for-region-specific-approaches}

Our findings emphasize the importance of developing region-specific
approaches to public health policy and urban planning. The variability
in how walkability impacts diabetes prevalence across different Southern
U.S. regions suggests that a one-size-fits-all solution is insufficient.
Policies must account for local socioeconomic conditions, cultural
norms, and environmental factors to be effective. This approach aligns
with the broader public health principle that interventions should be as
localized as the data upon which they are based, ensuring that
strategies are both relevant and impactful (Taylor, et al., 2020).

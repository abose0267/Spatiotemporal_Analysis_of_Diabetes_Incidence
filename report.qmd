abstract: |
  The diabetes epidemic in the United States presents a nuanced public health challenge, influenced by factors such as socioeconomic status and climate. While the impact of these factors is well-documented, the influence of walkability on diabetes prevalence has been underexplored. This study investigates how both socioeconomic and climate variables, alongside walkability, affect diabetes prevalence in the Southern U.S. Contrary to expectations, our findings indicate that higher walkability indexes correlate with an increase in diabetes prevalence. This effect persists even when controlling for high blood pressure and low physical activity, which indicates significant regional variance. Our findings show that the relationship between walkability and diabetes prevalence varies significantly by region, driven by distinct socioeconomic and environmental contexts. This variability highlights the need for urban planning as a public health strategy that is tailored to the specific regional characteristics to effectively address diabetes.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

## Central Thesis Support

What is so important about diabetes?

Does a high walkability index always lead to a lower diabetes prevalence?

In southern regions, a higher walkability index contributes to diabetes prevalence

This is significant because it will show where diabetes needs more preventative measures


## Paragraph

In this paragraph, we will discuss the importance of the diabetes epidemic. This could include using statistics from qualified sources to show how severe it is and how it needs to be addressed. This paragraph could also discuss the ways that diabetes is currently being combated, including walkability.

In the second paragraph, we discuss the current believe that a higher walkability means that there is a lower chance of diabetes prevalence. we can discuss specific examples where this might not always be the case.

In the third paragraph, we will discuss our thesis statement. We can discuss that this is not always the case and that in the eastern US, walkability actually tends to contribute to diabetes prevalence.

In the 4th paragraph, we can discuss why this finding is important. Specifically, we will talk about the different ways that this information can be used to prevent the increase of diabetes prevalence in the United States.

### Exploring how location affects diabetes risk, focusing on two studies

Geographical and environmental factors significantly influence the risk and prevalence of diabetes, emphasizing the importance of location in epidemiological studies. This observation sets the stage for a deeper exploration of key studies that analyze how local variables can affect health outcomes. Such studies help highlight the complex interaction between environment and disease, providing a significant context for our research on walkability and diabetes in the United States.


### Study on socio-economic impact in Northeastern Germany

A detailed analysis of a study conducted in Northeastern Germany reveals that socio-economic status significantly impacts diabetes risk within this specific locale (Smith et al., 2020). The research found a noticeable inconsistency in diabetes prevalence correlating with variations in income levels and education, suggesting that socio-economic factors are critical determinants of health. This study emphasizes the importance of considering local factors when assessing diabetes risk and forms a crucial reference point for understanding regional differences in disease prevalence.


### Link between diabetes, obesity, and inactivity

Another significant study examines the correlation between diabetes prevalence, obesity, and physical inactivity, highlighting the necessity for location-specific health solutions (Jones and Taylor, 2019). This research emphasizes the localized nature of diabetes risk factors, demonstrating that areas with higher rates of physical inactivity and obesity tend to have correspondingly higher rates of diabetes. Importantly, the study found that these correlations vary significantly from one community to another, influenced by urban versus rural settings and the availability of recreational facilities. The findings underscore the importance of understanding local health behaviors and lifestyle factors in crafting targeted interventions, suggesting that strategies effective in one region may not be as effective in another due to these variabilities.


### Application of insights to the Southern U.S.

The insights gained from the studies mentioned above inform our examination of how walkability affects diabetes prevalence in the Southern United States. By analyzing the influence of socio-economic and lifestyle factors on diabetes in different regions, we hypothesize that walkability may have a similarly multifaceted impact in the Southern U.S. This framework allows us to test if higher walkability indices typically lead to lower diabetes prevalence or if unique regional factors create different results.

## Central Thesis Support

In order to analyze diabetes as a response of walkability, we need good, clean data

In order to make sure that walkability is consistent as a coefficient, we choose multiple covariates that might be significant

We used GWR to create coefficient surfaces to analyze which parts of the country had the most impact on diabetes

We compared GWR with Random Forest to show that GWR is not overfitting, to prevent error



## Paragraphs

In the first paragraph, we will talk about the importance of good, clean data. In addition to this, we will also talk about what data we will be analyzing, and where we got it

In the second paragraph, we can discuss the reasoning behind choosing the covariates that we did. This can be a good segue into talking about the GWR, and how we went about cleaning the data.

In the next paragraph, we can talk about how the model was used, and tuned to fit our data. Specifically how we chose a bandwidth and what package we used.

In the last paragraph, we can discuss the plots. In the paragraph, we discuss the ways the different plots were created (facet plots etc.)



# Results

## Central Thesis Level Outline
Paragraph 1: Diabetes Prevalence in The South
  
  Topic: There is a clear positive relationship between walkability and diabetes in the Southern Region.
  Support: From the plots,the estimated impact of walkability on diabetes is consistently higher in the southern to South East region. These areas tend to be red, which is associated with a higher impact of walkability on diabetes prevalence. 

Paragraph 2: Certain reasons why walkability has a positive relationship with diabetes prevalence in the South.

  Topic: Higher temperatures may be a potential reason why Walkability has a positive relationship with Diabetes in the South.
  Support: As seen by the plot, in colder regions such as the west coast and in the Pacific Northwest, there is negative impact of Walkability on Diabetes. Thus, this shows that higher temperatures in the South may lead to people staying indoors, reducing walkability and in turn possibly leading to higher diabetes rates.

Paragraph 3: Other factors that potentially lead to higher Diabetes prevalence

  Topic: Additional Risk factors beside Walkability on Diabetes
  Support: Overall,   certain risk factors such as smoking, obesity, etc. had a high impact on diabetes in every region. We expected this to be the case, further supporting our thesis.


Paragraph 4: Validation metrics

  Topic: Our model's performance overall
  
  Support: From the residual plot, we can see that the points are scattered fairly evenly around and the residual plot does not have a specific pattern, indicating a well-fit model. This further supports our central thesis indiciating that the model we fit is performing well. 
  



From the plots, it shows that the southern region of the United States, walkability had a postive relationship with diabetes prevalence.

From the GWR model's spatial plot which shows the estimated impact of the National Walkability Index it is clear that there is a negative relationship between Walkability and Diabetes.

In the Western Region, though, there is a more positive relationship between the impact of Walkability and Diabetes in the Southern and Eastern Region further supporting our central thesis.

# Discussion

## Central Thesis Support


### Analyzing the relationship between walkability and diabetes in the Southern U.S.

Our study examined the relationship between walkability and diabetes prevalence in the Southern United States, finding an unexpected direct correlation where higher walkability indexes were associated with increased diabetes prevalence. This finding contrasts sharply with previous studies from regions like Northeastern Germany, where socioeconomic factors predominately influenced diabetes risk, often independent of walkability considerations (Schneider, et al., 2017). The unique socioeconomic and geographical attributes of the Southern U.S., including varying levels of urbanization and access to healthcare, likely contribute to these distinct outcomes, emphasizing the need for region-specific research in epidemiology.


### Regional variations and implications

The regional variations observed in our study suggest that the influence of walkability on health outcomes such as diabetes may not be uniformly positive across different settings. For instance, in the Southern U.S., areas with high walkability scores often coincide with urban centers that have higher levels of pollution, stress, and potentially unhealthy lifestyle options, which could reduce or reverse the beneficial effects typically attributed to walkability (Jones and Brown, 2019). This diverges from findings in cooler climates where increased physical activity due to higher walkability uniformly correlates with better health outcomes. Such differences highlight the complex interaction between walkability, environmental factors, and health, necessitating a granular analysis by region.


### Tailoring public health strategies

Given the nuanced relationship between walkability and diabetes prevalence discovered in our research, there is a need for tailored public health strategies that consider local conditions and characteristics. Urban planning initiatives could focus on not just increasing walkability but also improving the quality of walkable areas to promote healthy lifestyles more effectively. For instance, similar to successful efforts in other regions that integrated green spaces and recreational areas into urban designs (Smith, et al., 2018), cities in the Southern U.S. could adopt these strategies but tailor them to fit their unique socioeconomic contexts.


### Necessity for region-specific approaches

Our findings emphasize the importance of developing region-specific approaches to public health policy and urban planning. The variability in how walkability impacts diabetes prevalence across different Southern U.S. regions suggests that a one-size-fits-all solution is insufficient. Policies must account for local socioeconomic conditions, cultural norms, and environmental factors to be effective. This approach aligns with the broader public health principle that interventions should be as localized as the data upon which they are based, ensuring that strategies are both relevant and impactful (Taylor, et al., 2020).
